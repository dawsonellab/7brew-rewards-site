# ☕ 7 Brew Rewards Program Website

This project was developed during my Summer 2025 internship as a **Software Developer Intern at 7 Brew Coffee**. It is a full-stack web application that allows customers to earn, track, and redeem loyalty points. I built the site from scratch and integrated it with the company's backend systems using REST APIs.
